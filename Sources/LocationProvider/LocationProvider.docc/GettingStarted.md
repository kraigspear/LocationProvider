# Getting Started

Learn how to quickly integrate LocationProvider into your iOS or macOS app.

## Overview

LocationProvider provides a simple, modern way to get the user's current location with just a few lines of code. This guide walks you through the basic integration steps and your first location request.

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

Add LocationProvider to your project using Xcode's Package Manager:

1. In Xcode, go to **File > Add Package Dependencies...**
2. Enter the repository URL
3. Select the version you want to use
4. Add the package to your target

Alternatively, add it to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/yourusername/LocationProvider.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

## Configure Info.plist

Before using location services, add the required usage description keys to your app's `Info.plist`:

```xml
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs location access to show your current position.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app needs location access to provide location-based features.</string>
```

> Important: The system shows these messages to users when requesting location permissions. Make them descriptive and explain why your app needs location access.

## Your First Location Request

Here's the simplest way to get the user's current location:

```swift
import LocationProvider

// Create a LocationProvider instance
let locationProvider = LocationProvider()

// Request the current location
do {
    let location = try await locationProvider.gpsLocation()
    print("Current location: \(location.name ?? "GPS")")
    print("Coordinates: \(location.location.coordinate.latitude), \(location.location.coordinate.longitude)")
} catch {
    // LocationProvider provides specific, actionable error messages
    print("Failed to get location: \(error.localizedDescription)")
    // Example output: "Location access is disabled for this app. You can enable it in Settings > Privacy > Location Services."
}
```

## Understanding the Response

When you call `gpsLocation()`, LocationProvider returns a ``GPSLocation`` object that contains:

- **`name`**: A human-readable location name (e.g., "San Francisco") or `nil` if reverse geocoding fails
- **`location`**: The raw `CLLocation` object with coordinates, accuracy, and timestamp

> **Important**: LocationProvider now provides specific, actionable error messages when location requests fail. Instead of generic "location not found" errors, you'll get clear guidance like "Location access is disabled for this app. You can enable it in Settings > Privacy > Location Services."

```swift
let gpsLocation = try await locationProvider.gpsLocation()

// Access the readable name (nil if reverse geocoding failed)
print("You are in: \(gpsLocation.name ?? "Unknown location")")

// Access coordinate details
let coordinate = gpsLocation.location.coordinate
print("Latitude: \(coordinate.latitude)")
print("Longitude: \(coordinate.longitude)")

// Access additional location data
print("Accuracy: \(gpsLocation.location.horizontalAccuracy) meters")
print("Timestamp: \(gpsLocation.location.timestamp)")
```

## What Happens Behind the Scenes

When you call `gpsLocation()`, LocationProvider:

1. **Requests Permissions**: Automatically handles location authorization if needed
2. **Gets Location**: Waits for the first accurate GPS reading using `AsyncThrowingStream`
3. **Error Handling**: Maps Core Location errors to specific, user-friendly messages
4. **Reverse Geocodes**: Converts coordinates to a readable place name
5. **Returns Result**: Provides both coordinates and human-readable name

The entire process is designed to be quick and battery-efficient, stopping location services once a result is obtained.

### Improved Error Handling

LocationProvider now uses `AsyncThrowingStream` to properly surface Core Location errors with specific, actionable messages:

- **Authorization errors** are detected immediately and provide Settings instructions
- **Technical failures** distinguish between temporary GPS issues and permission problems
- **System-wide vs app-specific** permission issues are clearly differentiated
- **Cancellation errors** are filtered out as they represent normal app behavior

## Handling the Async Nature

Since location requests are asynchronous, use them within async contexts:

### In View Models

```swift
import Observation

@MainActor
@Observable
class LocationViewModel {
    var currentLocation: GPSLocation?
    var isLoading = false

    private let locationProvider = LocationProvider()

    func getCurrentLocation() async {
        isLoading = true
        defer { isLoading = false }

        do {
            currentLocation = try await locationProvider.gpsLocation()
        } catch let error as GPSLocationError {
            // LocationProvider provides specific, actionable error messages
            print("Location error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
            // Example: "Location access is disabled for this app. You can enable it in Settings > Privacy > Location Services."
        } catch {
            // Handle unexpected errors
            print("Unexpected error: \(error)")
        }
    }
}
```

### In SwiftUI Views

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var location: GPSLocation?
    private let locationProvider = LocationProvider()

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            if let location = location {
                Text("Current Location: \(location.name)")
            } else {
                Text("Tap to get location")
            }
        }
        .task {
            do {
                location = try await locationProvider.gpsLocation()
            } catch let error as GPSLocationError {
                // LocationProvider provides user-friendly error messages
                print("Location error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
                // Handle error appropriately (see Error Handling guide)
            } catch {
                // Handle unexpected errors
                print("Unexpected error: \(error)")
            }
        }
    }
}
```
